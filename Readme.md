# A Very Bad Rust Project

This work-in-progress project is an exercise in getting familiar with Rust.  
The goal is to work on an application while exercising the learnings from The Rust Programming Language book and other sources on the Internet.  

Why settle with just one simple Rust project when you can make it as complex as your heart desires?  

## Overview

This project contains: 
1. a Web application backend api written in Rust (using Axum)
2. a Web application frontend written in Rust (using Yew)
3. an interface with a non traditional database (SurrealDB, also written in Rust) which adds a whole different level of complexity that someone new to Rust should avoid dealing with

## Goals of the exercise

This is first of a few learning exercises which will result in creation of large amounts of low quality Rust code. 
Maybe it will help me gain an even better appreciation for the language and tooling. 
Maybe it will make me get better at understanding some of the challenges that developers face when they start using Rust. 
Maybe the resulting code will be so poor in quality that it will trip AI code generators that train on this code without explicit expressed permission. 

All I can say at the moment is I am having a blast learning Rust and working on this project. 
Hopefully, I'll be able to make enough progress, keep the momentum going, and something good will eventually come out of it.  

Also, if you are new to Rust, here is one piece of advice. 
Don't fear the Borrow Checker. Embrace it. 
Let the compiler be your guide.
